    <section><h3>Bio</h3><p>Christina Emmanuel is a recent graduate of the University of North Florida where she earned a
        Bachelorâ€™s of Fine Arts degree with a concentration in Painting/Drawing/Printmaking. Her oil paintings and intaglio prints
        eliminate the stigmatization of the natural hair texture of Black and mixed-Black people by
        portraying the complexity and beauty of their hair. Her oil paintings use matte medium to prime
        the canvas, retaining the raw tan color to emulate the natural state of the hair. Best seen in her
        <i>Hair</i> series, different styles of hair from both men and women are portrayed by this medium
        alongside the intaglio aquatints. Her work has been featured in the Museum of Contemporary
        Art (MOCA) and LuFrano Intercultural Gallery, located in Jacksonville, Florida.

    <section><h3>Artist Statement</h3><p>My art focuses on the appearance, characteristics, and various textures of African- hair. The hyphen
        encompasses African Americans, Afro-Hispanics, Black Asians, et cetera. The inspiration from this work
        stems from Caribbean culture. Much of the West Indies was under British/European rule between 1627
        and 1816. Consequently, most of the present-day settlers still retain these Eurocentric ideas of beauty,
        that natural, textured hair is unruly, messy, even nappy; whereas permed hair is clean, manageable, and
        more presentable. My art shows that there is absolutely nothing wrong with natural hair, that it is a
        work of art and beauty and just as worthwhile as any other hair texture.</p><p>
        The mediums I use are stretched canvas, rag paper, and intaglio using zinc plates. The canvas is primed
        with matte medium to retain the raw color and the reference is cropped and positioned to focus on the
        hair. The zinc plate is modified with the aquatint and sugar lift techniques to add gradients and highlights
        to the hair. Another technique involved is the use of rag paper and charcoal to create genre drawings of
        the typical hair care routine. This conveys the strenuous work put into maintaining the health and
        professionalism of textured hair.
